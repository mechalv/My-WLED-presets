# My-WLED-presets
The WLED presets that Iâ€™m using for my project. In case it helps anyone. Suggestions and improvements are welcome.
I'm using a QuinLED Dig-Uno with ws2811 LEDs, 111 pixels long. For the startup I use the preset 229. The last presents are used with button macros. I have a little change in my WLED that makes the "long" button press not go crazy while pressed and do 1-step jumps.
The uploaded presets work great with WLED 0.14.1-b3. Some of them, specially the playlists, may look strange, but they have been made taking into account some bugs that has WLED at the moment (for example that with "0" transition time the brightness does not change even if you want to), but I have used those bugs in my favor.
I hope that this helps someone. It took me loads of time to test and have the presets behave as I like, so I though to give something back to the comunnity as WLED is open-source and a lot of people have shared information, knowledge and videos without requesting anything back.
